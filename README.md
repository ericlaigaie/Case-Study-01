Repo for Case Study 01 (Doing Data Science Fall 2021)

MSDS 6306: Doing Data Science - Case Study 01

## Dataset:
  The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries. The datasets descriptions are as follows.

### Beers.csv:

  Name: Name of the beer.

  Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer.

  ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.

  IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.

  Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.

  Style: Style of the beer.

  Ounces: Ounces of beer.

### Breweries.csv:

  Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.

  Name: Name of the brewery.

  City: City where the brewery is located.

  State: U.S. State where the brewery is located.

### Instructions

You can assume that your audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (your client) and that they only have had one class in statistics and have indicated that you cannot take more than 7 minutes of their time. 20% of your grade will be based on the presentation. 

They have hired you to answer the 7 questions listed below and beyond those general questions you may speculate / anticipate what may be of interest to them.  


## Repo Contents	

1.  An RMarkdown file containing the following:
The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (your client) and that they only have had one class in statistics.         If it sounds like a student presentation, that is not acceptable.  You may assume that the CEO and CFO gave you the data and gave you the directive to report any                 interesting finding that you may uncover through your analysis.

Briefly explain the purpose of the code. The explanations should appear as a sentence or two before or after the code chunk. Even though you will not be hiding the code         chunks (so that I can see the code), you need to assume that the client can’t see them.

Use R to code answers concerning the seven questions below.
        1.   How many breweries are present in each state?
        2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  (RMD only, this does not need to be                 included in the presentation or the deck.)
        3.   Address the missing values in each column.
        4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
        5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
        6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
        7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and                 EXPLAIN your answer.
        8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its                 name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of                     course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.
        9. Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is                         important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence. 

2. Knit HTML file.  
In fact, you will also upload the knit html file to GitHub as well.  This will allow for plots and tables to supplement your answers (part e) to the 7 questions below.  You are already making an Rmd file, we should take advantage of it and knit a nice presentation of the project!  

3. Codebook, Both CSV files and a ReadMe.md
The Readme file describes the purpose of the project and codebook. The repo can be structured however you like, but it should make sense and be easily navigated.

4. PPT Slides 
Described more below and should have the link to your You Tube presentation … described further below as well.)
